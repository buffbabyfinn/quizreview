        <img src="img/rovani3.jpg">
        <p>
          Rovaniemi is a city and municipality of Finland. It is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland. It is situated about 10 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. There has probably been continuous settlement in the Rovaniemi area since the Stone Age. Periodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practise of slash and burn cultivation began around 750 to 530 B.C. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, HÃ¤me in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 A.D. onwards. The Sami are considered to be Laplands own indigenous population.
